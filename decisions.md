# Decisions Log

## Purpose

This document records relevant architectural and implementation decisions for the adopting repository.

Use it to preserve reasoning, avoid re-discussing settled trade-offs without context, and document deviations from `architecture.md` and `groundrules.md`.

## DEC-0001 - Separate MRL Core From Implementation Packs

- Date: 2026-03-29
- Status: accepted
- Owners: both

### Context
The starter was presenting Python plus a DDD-inspired modular monolith as if that were the default shape of MRL itself. That creates confusion when a repository needs another language, another architecture such as event sourcing, or more than one runtime.

### Decision
The repository now distinguishes between:

- MRL core, which stays artifact-driven and architecture-agnostic
- implementation packs, which define language, architecture, structure, and testing defaults

The current repository keeps `python_ddd_monolith` as the example selected pack.

### Consequences
It becomes easier to reuse the same refinement workflow across Python, JavaScript, Go, event-sourced, and polyglot client/server repositories. It also becomes necessary to make the selected pack explicit in architecture docs and slice docs.

### Alternatives considered
Keep one universal Python starter and treat every other shape as an undocumented deviation. This was rejected because it would keep conflating MRL with one implementation style.

### Notes
Future pack additions should live under `docs/packs/` and should be referenced by slice documents when the runtime topology matters.
